The model of work with GitHub

This picture demonstrates two separated areas: GitHub and your computer.

First, consider the GitHub's area. There are two repositories:

upstream is an original project's repo that you have forked
origin is your fork (copy) on GitHub to which you have full access
To provide changes from your fork to the original project's repo, you need to make a pull request as we did before.

If you want to make small changes in your repo (fork), you may use GitHub's web interface. But this approach is not convenient when developing programs, because you often need to run and debug them locally. The standard way is to create a local clone of a remote repository and work with it locally, periodically pushing changes to the remote repo.
